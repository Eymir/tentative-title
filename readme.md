##Explosion Time Calculator
###(Tentative Title)

Summer project for a couple CS majors trying to learn how to code for Android and iOS. This is a simple app project (nothing fancy) in order for use to learn our way around Android and iOS development. 

The apps will be for calculating simple things like: how long it will take for a fluid to reach a specific temperature in a specific container before exploding, etc. 

We probably won't publish this, as its just for fun and for learning, but we will license it under [GNU GPL v3](http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0).
